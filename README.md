Hey, I'm Miguel, and I just whipped up my very first front-end project.

 With a splash of my creativity and a bit of AI magic to boost performance, I tackled the fun challenge of cloning the Microsoft website's front page.

I kicked things off by setting up the page structure with HTML. I used some fancy-sounding tags for organization and accessibility.

 I made sure everything looked slick with links to images and whatnot.

The really cool part was when I got to play with CSS. I adjusted things like colors and font sizes super carefully to make sure my version looked just like the real Microsoft page. Flexbox and Grid came in handy for making everything look great on screens of all sizes.

For some extra oomph, I threw in a touch of JavaScript. I set up a snazzy product highlight carousel that changes stuff automatically and lets you take the wheel too.

 I even added nifty 'Read more' buttons for the news bits, making the whole thing a lot more interactive.

I wanted to make sure it looked perfect on all devices, so I used media queries to keep things snazzy.

Oh, and a little secret: I got some help from AI to make the code super efficient. It made the project even more awesome!

This project is a big deal for me on my web dev journey. My Microsoft clone is my way of showing how far I've come,

and it's also a tip of the hat to Microsoft's awesome design and dev crew.

If you're curious to see what I cooked up, feel free to check out my version of the Microsoft homepage.

I'm eager to hear what you think and to share more exciting stuff down the road!
